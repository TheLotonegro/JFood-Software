## JFood Different Parts
JFood consists of three main parts and every part also has some subparts that help the user to do some specific task. One of the most important sections of JFood is the user part, where most of the work is done on this part. Another important part of JFood is Admin Page. On this page admin of the app can access several options that control users who have Signed up. And the last main part of JFood is the Seller Page that offers some information about users and foods that have been sold. 
## User Part

There are some sections in this part. Users can select one of the categories at the bottom of the page and there is a sliding panel in the center of the page so users can see the best-priced foods. 
but while users don't log in to the app they cant add foods to their cart and after logging in they can see entered information in the top right panel. At the most left bar, there are some buttons to traverse between other pages like favorite page, category page, etc.
