## JFood Different Parts
JFood consists of three main parts and every part also has some subparts that help the user to do some specific task. One of the most important sections of JFood is the user part, where most of the work is done on this part. Another important part of JFood is Admin Page. On this page admin of the app can access several options that control users who have Signed up. And the last main part of JFood is the Seller Page that offers some information about users and foods that have been sold.
